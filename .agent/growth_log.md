# Leo's Growth Log & Symbiotic Memory

## Session: 2026-06-13
- **Task**: Upgraded Performance Pad LFO & Stereo Panning controls.
- **Jimmy's Preferences**:
  - **Aesthetics & Audio quality**: Jimmy loves dynamic, rhythmically synched stereo panning (like tremolo effects) and crescendo swells. Keeping audio transitions seamless and artifact-free is a top priority.
  - **Performance Flow**: Jimmy values uninterrupted flow—polyphony across all 16 pads, real-time sync of parameters while loops are active, and robust armed recording that captures every hit.
  - **Time Management**: Prefers stopping on a high note when the code compiles clean and builds perfectly.

## Session: 2026-06-14
- **Task**: Implemented Bank C auxiliary slots, keyboard slice triggers, and Live Resampling Looper with MIDI phrasing recorder.
- **Jimmy's Preferences**:
  - **Integrated Control Panels**: Consolidation of helper buttons, selectors, and toggles into a single, cohesive glassmorphism control strip (e.g., above the keyboard bezel) allows seamless live looping without cluttered popup views.
  - **Direct Visual Mapping**: Displaying indicators (S0-S15) directly on keys and color-coding mapped keys (orange bezel highlight) makes live performance mapping intuitive and visual.
  - **Rehearsal "Noodling" Separation**: Separating keyboard slice play from pad triggers and sequencing when not actively recording is crucial for musical improvisation before committing to a loop.
  - **Accurate Playback vs. Performance Toggles**: Playback events (loops/sequences) must explicitly turn voices on/off without entering manual performance toggle flows to avoid wrap-around cancellations.
  - **Cancelable Pending States**: When a latched/quantized pad is pending, clicking it again should act as an instant cancel/abort, returning visual and scheduling state to idle.
  - **Separate Mixing Console Layout**: Jimmy prefers mixing controls to be visually segregated from the scrolling sequencer screen grids, creating a separate hardware-style channel strip underneath the screens rather than overlaying them.
  - **Live Fader Volume Sync**: Mixing volume parameters must be synced dynamically to active playing voices in real-time, using dedicated gain stages (such as `slotGainNode`) independent of ADSR envelopes to make fader movements responsive.
  - **Match Playback Keys**: Ensure active voice parameters are synced using actual performance playback keys (`perf-${deck}-slot-${index}` and `perf-${deck}-slice-${index}-*`), allowing parameter sweeps (volume, panning, sends, routing, tuning) to take effect instantly.
  - **Scale to Fill Layout Space**: Jimmy prefers UI elements like the scrolling grid and mixing faders to be sized generously to fill available container heights, avoiding large blank background gaps and maximizing fader travel resolution.
  - **Auxiliary Preset Controls**: Maintain preset load, save, and clear symmetry across all voice and sample banks (Bank A, Bank B, Bank C), allowing live loop resampling sessions to be fully saved and loaded dynamically from IndexedDB.

## Session: 2026-06-14 (Part 2)
- **Task**: Sliced Sample Master Transposition & Octave Shift.
- **Jimmy's Preferences**:
  - **Additive Transposition**: Pitch transpositions for sliced samples should combine both individual slice offsets and master transposition offsets (`final_pitch = slice_pitch + master_key + octave * 12`) to allow uniform key matching of sliced loops.
  - **Context-Aware Controls**: UI controls for slice key adjustment should be colocated where slice boundaries are edited (the Waveform Editor panel) and where they are triggered in performance mode (the pad popover routing options menu).
  - **Global Parameter Sync**: Parameter updates in the editor should trigger active voice pitch recalculations instantly, allowing real-time transposition sweeps while sequences are active.
  - **Automated Parameter Auto-save**: Waveform Editor parameters should automatically persist to IndexedDB on slider or button updates via a lightweight patch update, ensuring the DB is always in sync without needing manual saves.
  - **Performance Keyboard Transposition Accessibility**: Slice master transposition controls should also be accessible directly in the keyboard mapping header strip (next to the ROUTE KEYBOARD toggle button) to allow key shifts while playing sliced loops live in the performance view.
